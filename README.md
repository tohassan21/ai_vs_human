## **Objective**
This project aims to build a supervised learning model that can identify whether an image was generated by artificial intelligence or created by a human. We use a dataset from Kaggle

## **Dataset**

We're using [dataset name] from Kaggle, which contains [X] AI-generated images and [Y] human-created images

Due to size limitations, the dataset is not stored directly in this repository. See the "Installation" section for instructions on how to obtain and set up the dataset

## **Technologies / Dependencies Needed and Used**
- **matplotlib**: A popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Used for plotting graphs, charts, and **visualizing model performance** in the project.

- **pandas**:  A powerful data analysis and manipulation library. Used for handling, cleaning, and transforming datasets efficiently.
- **os**: A built-in Python module for interacting with the operating system. Used for file and directory operations, such as reading and managing paths.
- **numpy**: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. Used for handling arrays, mathematical operations, and efficient data processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: A deep learning framework used for building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Includes modules for model architecture (Sequential, models), layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense), dataset handling (image_dataset_from_directory), and pretrained models (Xception for transfer learning).
